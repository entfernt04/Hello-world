Hello world )!
I have an experience in VBA coding for my current job and i like it very much. This "i like=drive" was also the starting point of my decision to change the profession. At the moment i'am trying to find out which of programming lanquage is better to learn. I realised that the website development  is not for me and it looks like i'am interested in coding the Applications.. So I start with Python and C++...
